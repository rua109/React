# Info

This project will create a React project from scratch (similar to `create-react-app`). Run the following command to make it happen -

```

The created React project uses `swc` insted of `babel` to transpile to javascript.

The following features are available:

- typescript
- jest
- prettier
- eslint
- storybook
- postcss
- tailwindcss

To follow the recipe used for creating this utility, read `docs/InstallingFromScratch.md`
